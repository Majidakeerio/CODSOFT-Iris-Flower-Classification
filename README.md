# CODSOFT-Iris-Flower-Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset (`IRIS.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `sepal_length`: Sepal length in centimeters
- `sepal_width`: Sepal width in centimeters
- `petal_length`: Petal length in centimeters
- `petal_width`: Petal width in centimeters
- `species`: Species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)

## Model
The classification model used in this project is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel.
